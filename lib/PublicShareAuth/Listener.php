/**
 * Custom behaviour for rooms to request the password for a share.
 *
 * The rooms to request the password for a share are temporary, short-lived
 * rooms intended to give the sharer the chance to verify the identity of the
 * sharee before granting her access to the share. They are always created by a
 * guest or user (the sharee) who then waits for the sharer (who will be the
 * owner of the room) to join and provide her the password.
 *
 * These rooms are associated to a "share:password" object, and their custom
 * behaviour is provided by calling the methods of this class as a response to
 * different room events.
