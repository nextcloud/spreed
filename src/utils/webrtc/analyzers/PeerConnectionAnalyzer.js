/**
 * Analyzer for the quality of the connection of an RTCPeerConnection.
 *
 * After creation "setPeerConnection(RTCPeerConnection)" must be called to set
 * the RTCPeerConnection to analyze. The analysis will start and stop
 * automatically based on the connection state, except when closed. Suprisingly,
 * "iceConnectionStateChange" is not called when the ICE connection state
 * changes to closed, so the change can not be detected from the
 * PeerConnectionAnalyzer. This change can be detected from the signaling,
 * though, and thus must be handled by the user of this class by calling
 * "setPeerConnection(null)" to stop the analysis. Similarly,
 * "setPeerConnection(null)" must be called too if the RTCPeerConnection is
 * active but the analyzer is no longer needed.
 *
 * Similarly, the analysis should be enabled only when audio or video are
 * enabled. This is also known from the signaling messages and needs to be
 * handled by the user of this class by calling "setAnalysisEnabledAudio(bool)"
 * and "setAnalysisEnabledVideo(bool)".
 *
 * The reason is that when audio or video are disabled the transmitted packets
 * are much lower, so it is not possible to get a reliable analysis from them.
 * Moreover, when the sent video is disabled in Firefox the stats are
 * meaningless, as the packet count is no longer a monotonic increasing value.
 *
 * The reported connection quality is mainly based on the packets lost ratio,
 * but also in other stats, like the amount of transmitted packets. UNKNOWN is
 * used when the analysis is started or stopped (including when it is done
 * automatically due to changes in the ICE connection status). In general even
 * if the quality of the connection is bad WebRTC is able to keep audio and
 * video at acceptable quality levels; only when the reported connection quality
 * is very bad or no data is transmitted at all the audio and video quality may
 * not be enough.
