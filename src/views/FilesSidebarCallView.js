 * Helper class to wrap a Vue instance with a FilesSidebarCallViewApp component
 * to be used as a secondary view in the Files sidebar.
 *
 * Although Vue instances/components can be added as tabs to the Files sidebar
 * currently only legacy views can be added as secondary views to the Files
 * sidebar. Those legacy views are expected to provide a root element, $el, with
 * a "replaceAll" method that replaces the given element with the $el element,
 * and a "setFileInfo" method that is called when the sidebar is opened or the
 * current file changes.
