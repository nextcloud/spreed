### Apply a license

All contributions to this repository are considered to be licensed under
the GNU AGPLv3 or any later version.

Contributors to the Spreed.me app retain their copyright. Therefore we recommend
to add following line to the header of a file, if you changed it substantially:

```
@copyright Copyright (c) <year>, <your name> (<your email address>)
```

For further information on how to add or update the license header correctly please have a look at [our licensing HowTo][applyalicense].

### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a additional safeguard
for the Nextcloud project. This is a well established and widely used
mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license
their contribution under the project's license.
Please read [developer-certificate-of-origin][dcofile].
If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

````
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
````

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)
like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with
`git ci` and the commit will be signed.
