## Get user¬¥s conversations

!!! note

    Due to the structure of the `lastMessage.reactions` array the response is not valid in XML.
    It is therefor recommended to use `format=json` or send the `Accept: application/json` header,
    to receive a JSON response.

!!! note

    When `modifiedSince` is provided only conversations with a newer `lastActivity` are returned. If `includeStatus` is set to `true` all one-to-one conversations will be returned to make sure the latest user status is returned.
    Due to the nature of the data structure we can not return information that a conversation was deleted
    or the user removed from a conversation. Therefore it is recommended to do a full refresh:
    * Every 5 minutes
    * When a signaling message of type `delete` or `disinvite` was received
    * Internal signaling mode is used


* Method: `GET`
* Endpoint: `/room`
