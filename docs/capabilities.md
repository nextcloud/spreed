* `empty-group-room` - Group conversations can be created without inviting a Nextcloud user group by default

## 3.2
* `guest-display-names` - Display names of guests are stored in the database, can be set via API (not WebRTC only) and are used on returned comments/participants/etc.
* `multi-room-users` - Users can be in multiple conversations at the same time now, therefor signaling now also requires the conversation token on the URL.

## 4.0

* `last-room-activity` - Conversations have the `lastActivity` attribute and should be sorted by that instead of the last ping of the user.

If the other participant posts a new chat message or starts a call, the left-participant will be re-added.

When it is enabled `attendeePin` will contain the unique dial-in code for this user.

## 11.0
* `chat-read-status` - On conversation API v3 and the chat API the last common read message is exposed which can be used to update the "read status" flag of own chat messages. The info should be shown only when the user also shares their read status. The user's value can be found in `config => chat => read-privacy`.
