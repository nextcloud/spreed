* `guest-signaling` - Guests can do signaling via api endpoints
* `empty-group-room` - Group conversations can be created without inviting a Nextcloud user group by default

## 3.2
* `guest-display-names` - Display names of guests are stored in the database, can be set via API (not WebRTC only) and are used on returned comments/participants/etc.
* `multi-room-users` - Users can be in multiple conversations at the same time now, therefor signaling now also requires the conversation token on the URL.

## 4.0
* `favorites` - Conversations can be marked as favorites which will pin them to the top of the conversation list.
* `last-room-activity` - Conversations have the `lastActivity` attribute and should be sorted by that instead of the last ping of the user.

## 6.0
* `locked-one-to-one-rooms` - One-to-one conversations are now locked to the users. Neither guests nor other participants can be added, so the options to do that should be hidden as well. Also a user can only leave a one-to-one conversation (not delete). It will be deleted when the other participant left too. If the other participant posts a new chat message or starts a call, the left-participant will be re-added.

* `sip-support` - Whether SIP can be configured and enabled by moderators. The conversations API will come with some new values `sipEnabled` which signals whether this conversation has SIP configured as well as `canEnableSIP` to see if a user can enable it. When it is enabled `attendeePin` will contain the unique dial-in code for this user.

## 11.0
* `chat-read-status` - On conversation API v3 and the chat API the last common read message is exposed which can be used to update the "read status" flag of own chat messages. The info should be shown only when the user also shares their read status. The user's value can be found in `config => chat => read-privacy`.
* `listable-rooms` - Conversations can searched for even when not joined. A "listable" attribute set on rooms defines the scope of who can find it.
