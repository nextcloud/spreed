## Constants

### Conversation types
* `1` "one to one"
* `2` group
* `3` public
* `4` changelog

### Read-only states
* `0` read-write
* `1` read-only

### Participant types
* `1` owner
* `2` moderator
* `3` user
* `4` guest
* `5` user following a public link


## Capabilities

### 3.0 (Initial Talk release)
* `audio` - audio is supported
* `video` - video + screensharing is supported
* `chat` - simple text chat is supported, superseded by `chat-v2`

### 3.1
* `guest-signaling` - Guests can do signaling via api endpoints
* `empty-group-room` - Group conversations can be created without inviting a Nextcloud user group by default

### 3.2
* `guest-display-names` - Display names of guests are stored in the database, can be set via API (not WebRTC only) and are used on returned comments/participants/etc.
* `multi-room-users` - Users can be in multiple conversations at the same time now, therefor signaling now also requires the conversation token on the URL.
* `chat-v2` - Chat messages are now [Rich Object Strings](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/1706) and pagination is available, the previous `chat` is not available anymore.

### 4.0
* `favorites` - Conversations can be marked as favorites which will pin them to the top of the conversation list.
* `last-room-activity` - Conversations have the `lastActivity` attribute and should be sorted by that instead of the last ping of the user.
* `no-ping` - The ping endpoint has been removed. Ping is updated with a call to fetch the signaling or chat messages instead.
* `system-messages` - Chat messages have a `systemMessage` attribute and can be generated by the system
* `mention-flag` - The conversation list populates the boolean `unreadMention` when the user was mentioned since their last visit
* `in-call-flags` - A new flag `participantFlags` has been introduced and is replacing the `participantInCall` boolean.

### 5.0
* `invite-by-mail` - *Replaced by `invite-groups-and-mails`* Guests can be invited with their email address
* `notification-levels` - Users can select when they want to be notified in conversations
* `invite-groups-and-mails` - Groups can be added to existing conversations via the add participant endpoint

### 6.0
* `locked-one-to-one-rooms` - One-to-one conversations are now locked to the users. Neither guests nor other participants can be added, so the options to do that should be hidden as well. Also a user can only leave a one-to-one conversation (not delete). It will be deleted when the other participant left too. If the other participant posts a new chat message or starts a call, the left-participant will be re-added.
* `read-only-rooms` - Conversations can be in `read-only` mode which means people can not do calls or write chat messages.
