## Constants

### Room types
* `1` "one to one"
* `2` group
* `3` public

### Participant types
* `1` owner
* `2` moderator
* `3` user
* `4` guest
* `5` user following a public link


## Capabilities

### 3.0 (Initial Talk release)
* `audio` - audio is supported
* `video` - video + screensharing is supported
* `chat` - simple text chat is supported, superseded by `chat-v2`

### 3.1
* `guest-signaling` - Guests can do signaling via api endpoints
* `empty-group-room` - Group rooms can be created without inviting a Nextcloud user group by default

### 3.2
* `guest-display-names` - Display names of guests are stored in the database, can be set via API (not WebRTC only) and are used on returned comments/participants/etc.
* `multi-room-users` - Users can be in multiple rooms at the same time now, therefor signaling now also requires the room/call token on the URL.
* `chat-v2` - Chat messages are now [Rich Object Strings](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/1706) and pagination is available, the previous `chat` is not available anymore.

### 4.0
* `favorites` - Rooms can be marked as favorites which will pin them to the top of the room list.
* `last-room-activity` - Rooms have the `lastActivity` attribute and should be sorted by that instead of the last ping of the user.
* `no-ping` - The ping endpoint has been removed. Ping is updated with a call to fetch the signaling or chat messages instead.
* `system-messages` - Chat messages have a `systemMessage` attribute and can be generated by the system
* `mention-flag` - The room list populates the boolean `unreadMention` when the user was mentioned since their last visit
* `in-call-flags` - A new flag `participantFlags` has been introduced and is replacing the `participantInCall` boolean.

### 5.0
* `invite-by-mail` - Guests can be invited with their email address
* `notification-levels` - Users can select when they want to be notified in conversations
* `new-chat-flow` - The read marker for the chat needs to be set manually, see [Better chat flow experience](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/1164)
