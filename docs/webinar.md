# Webinar management

Group and public conversations can be used to host webinars. Those online meetings can have a lobby, which come with the following restrictions:

* Only moderators can start/join a call
* Only moderators can read and write chat messages
* Normal users can only join the room. They then pull the room endpoint regularly for an update and should start the chat and signaling as well as allowing to join the call, once the lobby got disabled.

## Base endpoint

* API v1: üèÅ Removed with API v4: Nextcloud 17 - 21
* API v2: üèÅ Removed with API v4: Nextcloud 19 - 21
* API v3: üèÅ Removed with API v4: Nextcloud 21 only
* API v4: Base endpoint `/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v4`: since Nextcloud 22

All calls to OCS endpoints require the `OCS-APIRequest` header to be set to `true`.
