## Submitting issues

### Short version

 * The [**issue template can be found here**](https://raw.github.com/nextcloud/spreed/master/.github/issue_template.md) but be aware of the different repositories! See list below. Please always use the issue template when reporting issues.

### Guidelines
* Please search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.
  - Go to one of the repositories, click "issues" and type any word in the top search/command bar.
  - You can also filter by appending e. g. "state:open" to the search string.
  - More info on [search syntax within github](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues)
* Report the issue using our [template](https://raw.github.com/nextcloud/spreed/master/.github/issue_template.md), it includes all the informations we need to track down the issue.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.
