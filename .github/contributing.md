## Submitting issues

### Short version

 * Here you can find the [**bug report template**](https://raw.github.com/nextcloud/spreed/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/1_bug_report.md) and [**feature request template**](https://raw.github.com/nextcloud/spreed/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/2_feature_request.md), but be aware of the different repositories! See list below. Please always use the issue template when reporting issues.

### Guidelines
* Please search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.
  - Go to one of the repositories, click "issues" and type any word in the top search/command bar.
  - You can also filter by appending e. g. "state:open" to the search string.
  - More info on [search syntax within github](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues)
* Report the issue using our template for [bugs](https://raw.github.com/nextcloud/spreed/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/1_bug_report.md) and [features](https://raw.github.com/nextcloud/spreed/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/2_feature_request.md), it includes all the informations we need to track down the issue.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.

Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://nextcloud.com/community/code-of-conduct/). This document offers some guidance to ensure Nextcloud participants can cooperate effectively in a positive and inspiring atmosphere, and to explain how together we can strengthen and support each other.

### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a additional safeguard
for the Nextcloud project. This is a well established and widely used
mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license
their contribution under the project's license.
Please read [contribute/developer-certificate-of-origin][dcofile].
If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

````
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
````

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)
like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with
`git ci` and the commit will be signed.

### Apply a license

In case you are not sure how to add or update the license header correctly please have a look at [contribute/HowToApplyALicense.md][applyalicense]
